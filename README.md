**COMPANY:** COTECH IT SOLUTIONS
**ID:** CT08DS3113
**DOMAIN:** DATA SCIENCE
**DURATION:** 25TH JUNE TO 25TH JULY 

## Overview of the Project: DATA SCIENCE

### Project (TASK 1): EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) ON Heart Disease Prediction Dataset

### Objective: 
Start with a dataset of your choice and perform EDA using libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib or seaborn. Explore the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers. Visualize your findings with histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data.

### Key Activities:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Improving the quality of the data and to make it more suitable for the specific data mining task.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Ensuring that the data is free from any inconsistencies and missing values.
3. **Data Visualization:** Performing visualizations to understand various trends, relationships and distributions.
4. **Correlation Analysis:** Identifying correlations between heart patients over the years on various key factors.

### Inferences from the entire Project:

1. Males are at higher risk of heart disease.
2. Those who have never smoked have a higher rate of heart disease, and the lowest rate is in those who are former smokers.
People who have a family history of heart disease are more likely to develop it.
3. Diabetics are more likely to get heart disease.
4. Numerical data analysis gives insights into median values and skewness.
5. Columns with zero skewness indicate that the mean and median values are the same.
6. The average cholesterol levels are high in the sample data.
7. We have heart disease rate of 39.2 percent.




### Project (TASK 2): PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

### Objective: 
Implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.


### Key Activities:
1. Comprehend the Dataset: Identify features and target variables, learn about data kinds, and comprehend the data's context.
2. Data Cleaning: Remove missing values, outliers, and duplicates. Convert category variables to numerical form if necessary.
3. Feature Engineering: Add new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance. This could include interaction terms, polynomial features, or scaling numerical features.
4. Train-Test Split: Divide the data into training and testing sets to assess model performance on previously unseen data. A typical proportion is 80/20 or 70/30.
5. Choose and train the model: Create a simple linear regression model with the training data.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Change model parameters (if any) to increase performance; nevertheless, simple linear regression often has few tuning parameters.
7. Performance metrics: To evaluate the model, use measures such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²). These metrics provide information about the model's accuracy and explanatory power.
8. Residual Analysis: Examine the residuals (differences between actual and anticipated values) for patterns that suggest model flaws, such as heteroscedasticity or nonlinearity.
9. Predictions for Test Data: Use the trained model to forecast the target variable for the test set, then compare it to the actual values.
10. Visualize the results: Plot the regression line and the actual against projected values. Visualize residuals to better understand the model's fit and detect any anomalies or patterns.


### Inferences from the entire Project:
1. Understanding the Relationship of Variables:
Linear regression measures the degree and direction of the association between independent variables and the target variable. The coefficients show how much the target variable changes as a one-unit change in the predictor.
2. Model Evaluation and Interpretation:
R-squared (R²) indicates how much of the target variable's variance is explained by the model. A greater R² indicates a better fit, but not necessarily causation.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Determines the average squared difference between actual and forecasted values. Lower MSE indicates higher predicting accuracy.
3. Residue Analysis:
Helps discover model assumptions such as linearity and homoscedasticity (constant error variance). Patterns in residuals may indicate opportunities for model improvement or the need for more complicated models.
4. Limitations of Simple Linear Regression:
Real-world data frequently has numerous factors influencing the target variable. Simple linear regression may not capture complicated relationships, resulting in underfitting or inaccurate predictions.

This study shows how linear regression may be applied in real-world circumstances to forecast sales, costs, and other continuous outcomes. The insights provided can help to shape corporate decisions and strategy.
